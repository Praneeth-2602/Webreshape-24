# Library Management System

## Overview
This is a library management system built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The system aims to streamline the process of managing books, borrowers, and transactions in a library setting. It provides librarians with efficient tools to manage the libraryâ€™s collection and facilitates user interaction for borrowers.

## Features
- User authentication and authorization to differentiate between librarians and borrowers.
- CRUD operations for managing books, borrowers, and transactions.
- Book borrowing system with features for borrowing, returning, and renewing books.
- Intuitive and user-friendly interface for both librarians and borrowers.
- Responsive design for compatibility with different devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
- MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing book, borrower, and transaction data.
- Express.js: A web application framework for building backend APIs.
- React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development.
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens): Used for user authentication and authorization.
